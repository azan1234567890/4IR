                    class="img-fluid title-effect" alt="effect">Challenges in the Media Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>The launch of Smashing comes at a time when the media landscape is increasingly fragmented. Traditional platforms like Twitter have evolved, leading to the emergence of new competitors. Changes at Google and Meta have resulted in reduced traffic to online publishers, causing widespread layoffs in the media industry. AI technology is also affecting how news is consumed, with apps and search engines providing AI-generated summaries that potentially reduce clicks to original publishers.</p>

                    class="img-fluid title-effect" alt="effect">Smashing’s Unique Approach</h3>
            <p>Chandler believes Smashing can address these issues by surfacing high-quality content and encouraging users to visit the original publishers’ sites. Unlike traditional search engines that often yield SEO-optimized, ad-heavy pages, Smashing aims to provide valuable, interesting, and accurate content. Users can submit content, vote on recommendations, and follow their interests across various formats, including articles, podcasts, and videos.</p>

                    class="img-fluid title-effect" alt="effect">Community and AI Integration</h3>
            <p>Smashing combines AI technology with community-driven recommendations. Users can vote on content, with a limited number of votes each day to ensure only the best content is highlighted. The app’s AI provides summaries, key excerpts, and interesting pull quotes, while also identifying topics of interest to individual users. This blend of AI and human input aims to create a rich, curated content experience.</p>

                    class="img-fluid title-effect" alt="effect">Future Prospects</h3>
            <p>Smashing aims to drive traffic to original content rather than replacing it. The app’s design encourages the discovery of long-form, high-quality content amidst the internet’s vast information landscape. Smashing is currently backed by $3.4 million in seed funding and involves co-founders with expertise in media, technology, and AI.</p>

        img: "../assets/images/home/blog3.png",
        author: "Barry Krevoy",
        overview: `Elon Musk’s xAI recently made waves by releasing its Grok large language model as “open source” over the weekend. Musk’s move appears to position his company against rival OpenAI, despite the latter’s name suggesting openness. However, the question remains: does making Grok’s code available truly benefit the AI development community? The answer lies somewhere between yes and no.
        <br><br>
        Grok functions as a chatbot, akin to ChatGPT or Claude, with a distinctively sassy tone and access to Twitter data. While evaluating such systems remains challenging, experts generally consider Grok competitive with last-generation medium-size models like GPT-3.5. Whether one finds this impressive considering its short development time or disappointing given xAI’s resources is subjective.
        <br><br>
        Regardless, Grok represents a modern and capable large language model, and increased access to such technologies benefits the developer community. However, the crux of the issue lies in defining “open” in a meaningful manner beyond mere rhetoric or moral posturing.
        <br><br>
        The ambiguity surrounding terms like “open” and “open source” in the AI realm is not new. It extends beyond technicalities like licensing (Grok is licensed under Apache 2.0). The fundamental concern revolves around whether such initiatives genuinely foster collaboration and innovation or merely serve as PR maneuvers for companies or individuals.`,
